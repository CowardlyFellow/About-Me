# About-Me
》About Me! ;; Hello! My Name(s) is Kallen/Howdy/Michael/DJMM, As you can see I am a 'IRL'/Fictive of a few characters. I go by Any pronouns that are Masculine based, I can be Clingy when it comes to friends and can also misunderstand some things. I can be quite slow at regestering things and can get distracted easily too(I am quite stupid).

》 BYI;;

- Please use Tone-Tags as I have a hard time noticing jokes and such.
- I can Be rather Clingy with friends and such.
- I have bad anxiety when it comes to crowds (whether it be in a game or not)
- I can have NV/SV Episodes so bare with me (Non-Verbal/Slightly-Verbal)

》 DNI;; 
  - Basic DNI criteria! (Transphobe-Homophobe-etc) 
  - If you have a thing for being nitpicky to people with "TD" in their names (PT)
  - If you don't like being around other 'IRL's/Fictives! (I'm fine with this, I just don't wanna make others uncomfy!)
